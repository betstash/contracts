## Overview

The `Bets` module is a Move smart contract that provides the following functionality:

- **Initialize**: Initialize an account with an `AptBalance` resource.
- **Deposit**: Deposit APT tokens into an account.
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw APT tokens from an account.
- **Transfer**: Transfer APT tokens from one account to another.
- **Balance Check**: Check the balance of an account.

The module is designed to be secure and efficient, leveraging Move's resource-oriented programming model.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Move CLI](https://github.com/move-language/move): The Move command-line interface for compiling and testing Move modules.
- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli): Optional, if you plan to deploy the module on the Aptos blockchain.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/betstash/contracts.git
   cd contracts
   ```

2. Set up the Move environment:

   ```bash
   move init
   ```

---

## Compiling the Smart Contract

To compile the `Bets` module, run the following command:

```bash
move build
```

This will compile the Move module and generate the necessary bytecode files in the `build` directory.

---

## Testing the Smart Contract

The repository includes a set of test cases to verify the functionality of the `Bets` module. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
move test
```

### Test Output

If all tests pass, you should see output similar to this:

```

## Module Functions

### `initialize(account: &signer)`

Initializes an account with an `AptBalance` resource. The balance is set to `0`.

### `deposit(account: &signer, amount: u64)`

Deposits the specified amount of APT tokens into the account.

### `withdraw(account: &signer, amount: u64)`

Withdraws the specified amount of APT tokens from the account.

### `balance_of(account_addr: address): u64`

Returns the balance of the specified account.

### `transfer(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64)`

Transfers the specified amount of APT tokens from one account to another.

---

## Test Cases

The following test cases are included to verify the functionality of the `Bets` module:

1. **`test_initialize`**: Verifies that the `initialize` function correctly initializes an account with a balance of `0`.
2. **`test_deposit`**: Verifies that the `deposit` function correctly increases the balance of an account.
3. **`test_withdraw`**: Verifies that the `withdraw` function correctly decreases the balance of an account.
4. **`test_balance_of`**: Verifies that the `balance_of` function returns the correct balance of an account.
5. **`test_transfer`**: Verifies that the `transfer` function correctly transfers tokens between accounts.
